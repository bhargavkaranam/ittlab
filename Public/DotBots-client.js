			abs_dir is basically the player's input.
			Client acts upon input immidiately.
			Let REAL TIME be defined as the time when a client inputs on his local machine.
			Server runs the entire world C1 ms late, and detects collisions
			C1 is the maximum lag between server and client, nerfed to a realistic value.
			Client runs 2*C1 ms in the past.
			Client, while playing 2*C1 in the past, would be getting accurate world information at constant delay.
			"Not getting hunted" would be given priority over being hunted. Not being able to escape because of lag is worse than not being able to hunt because of lag.
			If a client DCs, then extrapolation using last known inputs is canonical, and client will be reset to canonical position when he reconnects.
			No jumping tolerated.
